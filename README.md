# Frenchify

Website built using the material-ui library for the sole purpose of having somewhere to constantly practice the aspects of the French language which require rote/constant memorization. There are options to practice articles for masculine/feminine nouns, voabulary, definite/indefinite/partitive articles, and verb conjugations (présent, passé composé, imparfait, and futur simple) for now.
